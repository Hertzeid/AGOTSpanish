agot_filler_kingslanding.0039.desc:0 "Although in ruins, the Dragonpit that looms over the Hill of Rhaenys is nothing to sneeze at. Commissioned by King Maegor, the massive structure was built on top of the ruins of the Sept of Remembrance after Maegor had it razed to the ground. It was to serve as a stable for the dragons, with doors large enough for two dozen knights to ride through at once. However, after being stormed during the Dance of Dragons, the pit’s dome fell and it was sadly abandoned." #NT!
agot_filler_kingslanding.0039.a:0 "This is something I want to see up close." #NT!

agot_filler_kingslanding.0040.desc:0 "The ruins are mesmerizing in their grandeur, and I’m so distracted that I don’t notice the wooden floors crumbling beneath me until I’m falling through it. Although the fall doesn’t harm me, I find myself surrounded by ash and charred bones. Ew. I pull myself out from the mess and flee the Dragonpit all together. \n\nLater in the day, I recall how during the Spring Sickness, the bodies had been so many that the Pyromancer’s Guild had to use the Dragonpit to burn the dead." #NT!
agot_filler_kingslanding.0040.a:0 "I don’t think I’ll ever be able to unsee all those bones…" #NT!

agot_filler_kingslanding.0041.desc:0 "As I explore the Dragonpit, a young woman approaches me. At first, I think this is a strange place to meet such a nice young maiden, but then I remember the rumors that the Dragonpit is used by some for… intimate encounters, and this young woman seems quite interested in exploring much more than the Dragonpit." #NT!

agot_filler_kingslanding.0042.desc:0 "I cannot even begin to believe my eyes! Even as rubble, the craftsmanship that went into building such a place. Such a shame that it’s lost to King Maegor’s paranoia – but I can’t help but marvel regardless." #NT!
agot_filler_kingslanding.0042.a:0 "I’ve truly been inspired!" #NT!

agot_filler_kingslanding.0043.a:0 "Here, buy yourself a warm meal." #NT!
agot_filler_kingslanding.0043.b:0 "I’ll take those – you’d just waste all this coin anyway." #NT!
