 agot_filler_vale.200.desc:0 "The Mountains of the Moon are an inhospitable place filled with even more inhospitable men. From time to time, these mountain clansmen must be pushed back into the mountains, should they come raiding the fertile lands of the Vale.\n\nWhile pursuing a clansmen raiding party through a familiar mountain pass with a small entourage, the weather takes a turn for the worse. Before I realize it, I find myself alone — wholly enveloped in a crushing blizzard with no sense of direction." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.200.a:0 "I must press on." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.200.a_tt:0 "These mountains are home to shadowcats, and worse..." #NT!

 agot_filler_vale.201.desc:0 "I must keep moving; the frost has started to take over my limbs.\n\nLo, what's that ahead? Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the figure of a man approaching through the snow squall?" #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.201.a:0 "It must be a mountain clansman." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.201.a_tt:0 "I've no option but to make common cause and survive. Desperate times make for desperate alliances..." #NT!

 agot_filler_vale.202.desc:0 "My unexpected companion and I make haste through the storm. He clearly knows these mountains, and before long, we've arrived at his clan hall.\n\nWe take a seat by a roaring fire; warmth has never felt so good. A hot meal is placed before us, and I happily break bread with this clansman — if only to ensure guest right.\n\nBut as we exchange thanks and discuss our ways of life, I can't help but feel we are more similar than different. Perhaps, even, I could befriend this clan chief and win myself a worthy ally." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.202.a:0 "We ought to spill ale at feasts, not blood in war." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.202.a_tt:0 "I've found common ground with my host, and now I can call him a friend." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.202.b:0 "Me, sharing supper with a savage?" #NT!

 agot_filler_vale.203.desc:0 "The storm has finally broken, and the clan chief has invited me to play a local game of his mountain tribe. He even promises a small favor if I win, with a wink." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.203.a:0 "Sounds interesting!" #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.203.a_tt:0 "Your friendship with the clansman flourishes." #NT!

 agot_filler_vale.204.desc:0 "The game begins!\n\nA checkered board is placed between us, scattered with stone pebbles of light and dark grey. We take turns moving these pieces around the board, claiming the other's pieces in a mock battle of wills." #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.204.a:0 "You're going to lose, friend!" #NT!
 agot_filler_vale.204.a_tt:0 "Some friendly competition never hurts..." #NT!

 agot_filler_vale.206.desc:0 "It feels bittersweet, to leave my friend after all we've been through.\n\nWe swear an oath of alliance and friendship before we take separate ways at a crossroads, and I return home." #NT!

 agot_filler_vale.206.a_tt:0 "I return home, reinvigorated." #NT!
